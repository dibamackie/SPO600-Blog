    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Initially, I planned to build a Snake game, but after facing challenges with movement, I switched to a simpler guessing game called Lucky Digits. This project was exciting and challenging as I explored low-level programming, <a href="String.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ROM routines</a>, and memory manipulation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2>How the Game Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The game generates a random number.</li>
        <li>The user guesses a number between 0 and 5.</li>
        <li>The game compares the user input with the generated number.</li>
        <li>If correct, the screen turns green; if incorrect, it turns red.</li>
        <li>The game continues until the user guesses correctly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2>Code Walkthrough</h2>
      <h3>Initialization</h3>
      <pre>
START:
    LDA $FE        ; Load random value from memory
    AND #$07       ; Mask out upper bits, keeping values 1-5
    CLC
    ADC #$01       ; Ensure within range 1-5
    STA random_number
      </pre>

      <h3>User Input Handler</h3>
      <pre>
GET_NUMBER:
    LDA #$00        ; Clear value
    STA value
    JSR CHRIN       ; Get input character
    CMP #$30        ; Ensure valid digit ('0')
    BCC GET_NUMBER
    CMP #$36        ; Ensure valid digit ('5')
    BCS GET_NUMBER
    SEC
    SBC #$30        ; Convert ASCII to binary
    STA value
    JSR CHROUT
      </pre>

      <h3>Screen Color Change</h3>
      <pre>
CORRECT:
    LDA #$05      ; Green color
    JSR SET_COLOR
    JMP END_GAME  
INCORRECT:
    LDA #$02      ; Red color
    JSR SET_COLOR
    JMP GUESSNUMBERS  
      </pre>

      <h3>Color Fill Routine</h3>
      <pre>
SET_COLOR:
    LDY #$00
    STY SCRN_PTR
    LDX #$02
    STX SCRN_PTR_H
    LDX #$04   ; Pages to fill
fill_screen:
    STA (SCRN_PTR),Y
    INY
    BNE fill_screen
    INC SCRN_PTR_H
    DEX
    BNE fill_screen
    RTS
      </pre>

      <h2>Challenges and Learning</h2>
      <p>Working with assembly requires a deep understanding of memory operations. Debugging was particularly difficult as there were no built-in debugging tools. Managing screen color changes required careful memory handling. I experimented with ROM routines before implementing this lab.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Building Lucky Digits was a fascinating experience in low-level programming. I plan to improve this game with animations and remain enthusiastic about eventually implementing a Snake game.</p>
